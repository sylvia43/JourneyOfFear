1) Storyline

  There is a seperate document regarding the character's background and general plot to be posted, for it is a WIP.
  
  
2) Gameplay

  2.1 Open World
    In the game, you can choose what to do, namely kill monsters, do quests, or explore dungeons.
	 
    2.1.1 Overworld/Killing Monsters
      In the overworld, you can explore and kill monsters. Trash mobs are interspersed with more difficult elite
      enemies and occasionally boss enemies. All enemies will have random attributes drawn, which make them
      significantly easier or harder.
  
    2.1.2 Quests/Storyline
      When doing quests, there are specific quest areas on the map. These are usually unique areas or pre
      generated dungeons. The monsters will have different stat pools, and the dungeons will have different puzzle
      pieces.
  
    2.1.3 Dungeons
      Dungeons are semi-randomly generated, and are tests of strategy and skill rather that action. They are
      created with predetermined puzzle pieces which are stitched together. Dungeons strive to be like the early
      Legend of Zelda games, where you can spend hours and miss a  crucial detail vital to beating the dungeon.
      However, since they are partially randomized, you can't always look it up. Dungeons also include powerful
      boss monster at crucial points, as well as rooms of weaker enemies, just to keep you on your toes. These
      fights are meant to be strategic, as facing a roomful of enemies is not generally fun, if it can be avoided.
      Boss monster are also meant to be strategic as well as difficult.
	  
  2.2 Levelling and Experience
    One of the main goals of levelling is to reward time spent in game while preventing the player from outright
    grinding. Items will probably have their own levels, and OOD (Out of Depth) monsters as well as trash mobs and
    underlevel enemies will grant no experience.
	 
	  
3) Code

  3.1 Slick2D
    Slick2D is a (unsupported?) library built on LWJGL for 2D game development. Most people have moved on to LibGDX but
    meh. Slick2D is actually really underestimated, sure I have to write my own collision detection, but it's still
    pretty neat.
	 
  3.2 Sprites, animations, and masks
    Sprites are the images that represent an object, in this case, the animations in each of the four directions, plus
    the masks of that object. Masks are used for collision detection. For the player and other entities, they have
    separate masks for each animation frame. This prevents collisions when the user sees no collision. However, attacks
    have rectangular masks. This is because attack animations are generally less precise than the ones for movement.
	 
    There are currently 4 classes dealing with these, plus the inbuilt Slick animation class. ImageMask holds a
    mask for a single image. AnimationMask holds 4 ImageMasks to cover an entire 4 frame animation. EntitySprite
    holds 4 Animations and AnimationMasks to cover animations in all four directions.
